    <p>"Our story is unique, just like yours. And
        we’re thrilled about spending time with you.
        We love to express ourselves in freedom, we
        cherish purity and nature, we value harmony
        and design. The place in which all this comes
        together? Scandinavia.

    <p>
        Launched in 1988, Danish Design has been
        around for a while but time hasn’t stood still;
        just like you, we have lived and closed unique
        chapters in life after which we started new
        ones. We have found our Harmony in Nature
        and Design; we have let it inspire us to become
        better, be sustainable and to be there for you
        whenever you seek us.
        Our carefully curated collections offer endless opportunities to spark up a conversation about what's on your
        wrist. Find a watch as unique as you are!</p>
